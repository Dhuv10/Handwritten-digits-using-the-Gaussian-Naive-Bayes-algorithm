MNIST digit classification using Gaussian Naive Bayes with feature normalization.
# ✍️ Handwritten Digit Classification using Gaussian Naive Bayes (MNIST)

This project applies a **Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier** to the MNIST dataset for digit classification. It serves as a baseline comparison against more complex deep learning models, achieving an accuracy of **55.59%** with careful feature normalization.
